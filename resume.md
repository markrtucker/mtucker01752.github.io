## Work Experience

### Principal Software Engineer, Geospatial Analytics, IBM (September, 2016 - May, 2019)

Lead developer for data ingestion processing for IBM PAIRS - the geospatial analytics data platform at the core of IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite. We ingest data from disparate sources (weather forecast, weather observations, satellite and aerial imagery, etc.) and align it into a consistent projection for centralized storage and later analytics and query processing.

- Led the effort to modernize the data ingestion process, migrating research-written, shell script based processing into a Python based scalable workflow solution
- Ported legacy Travis-based build system into Jenkins, enabling consistent security scans and automated testing on a reliable and scalable platform
- Architected and implemented the solution for migrating the ingestion process from a bare-metal docker deployment into a cloud-based kubernetes deployment, enabling 30x faster ingestion through horizontal scaling while reducing the overall solution cost by a factor of 2

### Architect, Watson Visual Recogntion, IBM (September, 2016 - May, 2019)

Architect and lead developer for the Watson Visual Recognition service. This service allows users to quickly and accurately tag, classify and search visual content using machine learning algorithms.

- Led development effort to port the Visual Recognition service from monolithic AWS deployment to a service-oriented, containerized deployment on Kubernetes in the IBM Cloud.
- Demonstrated scalable architecture showing how this system could scale from the original system's 10 requests per second to over 500 requests per second via horizontal scaling techniques.
- Mentored multiple junior developers to guide significant new microservice development, and also to port existing code.
- Led effort to re-define the API to consolidate capabilities into a consistent framework, simplifying the overall architecture of the service while providing increased usability of the REST API.
- Led a squad of 7 developers to design, implement, test, and deploy the new Custom Object Detection feature,

### Test-Focused Software Engineering Manager, Watson Cloud Services, IBM (April, 2014 - August, 2016)

- Provided direct project management and oversight for multiple concurrent projects, assigning tasks and setting priorities in order to accomplish business objectives.
- Worked closely with senior managers and architects to develop cohesive and meaningful plans that supported high-level business objectives.
- Coordinated with peer managers to identify and track dependencies in order to ensure components were developed, tested, and made available based on agreed upon timelines to meet overall business goals.
- Utilized agile development practices to provide increased project visibility, accurate prediction of project completion, high quality software, and continuous improvement of internal processes

### Technical Lead, Metadata Asset Manager, IBM (April, 2009 - February, 2013)

Technical project  leader and lead engineer for IBM Metadata Asset Manager – a mid-size (~100KLOC) web-based, service-oriented metadata management application.

- Advocated for, introduced, and implemented agile development practices, including: short development cycles, unit testing, early behavior-driven acceptance testing, frequent demonstrations of new functionality, and retrospectives.
- Conducted design and code reviews for all non-trivial implementation tasks to ensure adherence to the established architecture, compliance with coding standards, and alignment of the implementation with established best practices.
- Provided direct technical and project guidance to globally distributed team of up to 15 software developers.
- Assigned tasks, prioritized work items, and provided architectural oversight of the entire product.

### Senior Software Engineer, Metadata Server, Ascential Software / IBM (August, 2003 - March, 2009)
