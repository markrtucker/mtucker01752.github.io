# Recruiter Info

Dear Recruiters,

I get a *lot* of email/LinkedIn messages about job opportunities. While I am happy to read these messages, you should know that I am not actively looking (at least as of August, 2018). So I am *very* selective about what I will even consider. Before reaching out to me, these are the basic requirements for me to consider any discussion about a new opportunity.

- **Location**: Because of my current personal and family situation, I am not willing to take on a long commute. This means that I would only consider jobs in the Metro-West area (i.e., Framingham, Marlborough, Westborough, and perhaps immediately surrounding towns).
- **Team**: I really enjoy working with a co-located, diverse team of smart people solving hard problems. I am not interested in working on a team that is highly distributed. I *might* consider a situation where a company is completely remote and has the tools and culture to support this environment.
- **Problem Domain**: I mentioned solving hard problems. I am not interested in working on an e-commerce site or some other commodity-type solution. I'm also not interested in "personal marketing" in any form.
- **Technology**: I have worked hard to remain pragmatic and flexible around tools and languages throughout my career. I am not tied to anything specific. That said, I see languages like Go and Python as the next wave in the industry. I am not interested in working in Java.
- **Career Path**: One of the things I like about working for IBM is that there is a clear, defined, non-managerial career path for software professionals. I tried management - I didn't like it. I can still offer leadership in a non-management role.
- **Salary**: Without getting in to specifics, IBM's technical career path offers pay grades above the typical "senior software engineer" role. Since I am reasonably happy in my current position, I will absolutely not consider taking a pay cut for any new opportunity.

So, if you have a position that meets all of these points, please do feel free to reach out to me. Please include details that let me know you have read this and how your job aligns with my requirements. If you reach out with opportunities that do not **clearly** match these criteria, you will get a simple "no thanks" response.

I know your job is hard - I'm trying to make it easier by laying out the basic requirements so that you can quickly rule me out as a potential candidate.

Thanks
- Mark
