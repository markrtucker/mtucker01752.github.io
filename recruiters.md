# Recruiter Info

Dear Recruiters,

I get a *lot* of email/LinkedIn messages about job opportunities. While I am happy to read these messages, I am *very* selective about what I will even consider. Before reaching out to me, please consider these basic requirements for any new opportunity.

- **Location**: Since 2020, I have grown to love working at home. I'm looking for a remote-first opportunity. That said, if there is a great company that is in the Metro-West area (i.e., Framingham, Marlborough, Westborough, and perhaps immediately surrounding towns), then I might consider a hybrid working environment.
- **Team**: I really enjoy working with a diverse team of smart people solving hard problems. Company culture matters. Representation matters. I am not interested in an organization that pays lip service to DEI.
- **Problem Domain**: I mentioned solving hard problems. I am not interested in working on an e-commerce site or some other commodity-type solution. I'm also not interested in "personal marketing" in any form.
- **Technology**: I have worked hard to remain pragmatic and flexible around tools and languages throughout my career. I am not tied to anything specific. That said, modern languages like Go, Rust, and Python are the next wave in the industry. I am not interested in working in Java, C, or C++.
- **Career Path**: One of the things I like about working for IBM is that there is a clear, defined, non-managerial career path for software professionals. I tried management - I didn't like it. I still have leadership responsibilities in a non-management role.
- **Salary**: While the above items are my priorities, solid compensation is table stakes. I will not consider taking a pay cut for any new opportunity. If the base salary starts with a "1", count me out.
- **Travel**: I am not interested in a position that requires a lot of travel. My current family situation makes travel somewhat complicated. Minimal, domestic travel is fine, assuming some degree of flexibility.

If you have a position that meets all of these points, please do feel free to reach out to me. Please include details that let me know you have read this and how your job aligns with my requirements. If you reach out with opportunities that do not **clearly** match these criteria, you will get a simple "no thanks" response.

I know your job is hard - I'm trying to make it easier by laying out the basic requirements so that you can quickly rule me out as a potential candidate.

Thanks
- Mark
